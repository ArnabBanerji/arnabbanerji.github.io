                Several Bootstrap components utilize z-index, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a
                third axis to arrange content. We utilize a default z-index scale in Bootstrap that’s been designed to
                properly layer navigation, tooltips and popovers, modals, and more.
                <br>
                These higher values start at an arbitrary number, high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts.
                We need a standard set of these across our layered components—tooltips, popovers, navbars, dropdowns,
                modals—so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors. There’s no reason we couldn’t have used 100+
                or 500+.
                <br>
                We don’t encourage customization of these individual values; should you change one, you likely need to
                change them all.

                Several Bootstrap components utilize z-index, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a
                third axis to arrange content. We utilize a default z-index scale in Bootstrap that’s been designed to
                properly layer navigation, tooltips and popovers, modals, and more.
                <br>
                These higher values start at an arbitrary number, high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts.
                We need a standard set of these across our layered components—tooltips, popovers, navbars, dropdowns,
                modals—so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors. There’s no reason we couldn’t have used 100+
                or 500+.
